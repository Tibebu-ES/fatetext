_Text format:_

In the printed book, line numbers were squeezed in wherever there was
room. For the e-text, they have been regularized to the EETS-standard
multiples of 4. Line divisions and page numbers were retained for use
with the Index and linenotes, except that some very short words have
been moved up or down to avoid awkward gaps. Headnotes have been
moved to the nearest convenient line break.

Italics representing expanded abbreviations are shown in b{ra}ces.
Other italics are shown conventionally with _lines_. Superscripts are
shown with ^ (caret); they always continue to the end of the word.
Oversized initial letters are shown with double leading ++ as ++A. In
the Appendix, decorative final letters are shown with single + as dar+,
sprong+. Italic thorn (?) and yogh (?) seem to have been unavailable to
the printer; both letters have been formatted to match the surrounding
text.

The inverted semicolon (rare) is shown in brackets as [;]. All other
bracketed letters or letter groups are in the original.

In the primary text, anomalous spellings with initial "u" or non-initial
"v" are not individually noted. Other errors, whether corrected or not,
are listed at the end of the e-text.

For this e-text, Chaucer's translation of the _Consolatio_ is given
twice: first as printed, with all notes and apparatus, and then as text
alone.]

INTRODUCTION.


When master hands like those of Gibbon and Hallam have sketched the life
of _Boethius_, it is well that no meaner man should attempt to mar their
pictures. They drew, perhaps, the most touching scene in Middle-age
literary history,--the just man in prison, awaiting death, consoled by
the Philosophy that had been his light in life, and handing down to
posterity for their comfort and strength the presence of her whose
silver rays had been his guide as well under the stars of Fortune as the
mirk of Fate. With Milton in his dark days, Boece in prison could say,--

                                  'I argue not
  Against Heaven's hand or will, nor bate a jot
  Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer
  Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask?
  The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied
  In liberty's defence, my noble task,
  Of which all Europe rings from side to side.'

For, indeed, the echoes of Boethius, Boethius, rang out loud from every
corner of European Literature. An Alfred awoke them in England, a
Chaucer, a Caxton would not let them die; an Elizabeth revived them
among the glorious music of her reign.[I-1] To us, though far off, they
come with a sweet sound. 'The angelic' Thomas Aquinas commented on him,
and many others followed the saint's steps. Dante read him, though,
strange to say, he speaks of the Consolation as 'a book not known by
many.'[I-2] Belgium had her translations--both Flemish[I-3] and
French[I-4]; Germany hers,[I-5] France hers,[I-6] Italy hers.[I-7] The
Latin editors are too numerous to be catalogued here, and manuscripts
abound in all our great libraries.

No philosopher was so bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of
Middle-age writers as Boethius. Take up what writer you will, and you
find not only the sentiments, but the very words of the distinguished
old Roman. And surely we who read him in Chaucer's tongue, will not
refuse to say that his full-circling meed of glory was other than
deserved. Nor can we marvel that at the end of our great poet's life, he
was glad that he had swelled the chorus of Boethius' praise; and 'of the
translacioun of Boece de Consolacioun,' thanked 'oure Lord Ihesu Crist
and his moder, and alle the seintes in heuen.'

The impression made by Boethius on Chaucer was evidently very deep. Not
only did he translate him directly, as in the present work, but he read
his beloved original over and over again, as witness the following list,
incomplete of course, of passages from Chaucer's poems translated more
or less literally from the _De Consolatione_:

    [Footnote I-1: Other translations are by John Walton of Osney, in
    verse, in 1410 (Reg. MS. 18, A 13), first printed at Tavistock in
    1525, and to be edited some time or other for the E.E.T.S. An
    anonymous prose version in the Bodleian. George Coluile, alias
    Coldewel, 1556; J. T. 1609; H. Conningesbye, 1664; Lord Preston,

    anon. 1792 (Lowndes).]

    [Footnote I-2: Dante, in his _Convito_, says, "Misimi a legger
    quello _non conosciuto da molti_ libro di Boezio, nel quale
    captivo e discacciato consolato s'avea."]

I. LOVE.

  Wost thou nat wel the olde clerkes sawe,
  That who schal yeve a lover eny lawe,
  Love is a grettere lawe, by my pan,
  Then may be yeve to (of) eny erthly man?

    (_Knightes Tale, Aldine Series_, vol. ii. p. 36, 37.)

  But what is he ?at may ?eue a lawe to loueres. loue is a gretter
  lawe and a strengere to hym self ?an any lawe ?at men may ?euen.

    (_Chaucer's Prose Translation_, p. 108.)

  _Quis legem det amantibus?
  Major lex amor est sibi._

    (Boeth., lib. iii. met. 12.)


II. A DRUNKEN MAN.

  A dronke man wot wel he hath an hous,
  But he not[I-8] which the righte wey is thider.

    (_Knightes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 39.)

  _Ry?t as a dronke man not nat[I-9] by whiche pa?e he may retourne
  home to hys house._

    (Chaucer's Trans., p. 67.)

  _Sed velut ebrius, domum quo tramite revertatur, ignorat._

    (Boeth., lib. iii. pr. 2.)

    [Footnote I-8: The Harl. MS. reads _not nat_, to the confusion of
    the metre.]

    [Footnote I-9: = ne wot nat = knows not.]


III. THE CHAIN OF LOVE.

  The firste moevere of the cause above,
  Whan he first made the fayre cheyne of love,
  Gret was theffect, and heigh was his entente;
  Wel wist he why, and what therof he mente;
  _For with that faire cheyne of love he bond
  The fyr, the watir, the eyr, and eek the lond
  In certeyn boundes, that they may not flee._

    (_Knightes Tale_, p. 92.)

  That ?e world with stable feith / varieth acordable chaungynges //
  ?at the contraryos qualite of element? holden amonge hem self
  aliaunce perdurable / ?at phebus the sonne with his goldene
  chariet / bryngeth forth the rosene day / ?at the mone hath
  commaundement ouer the nyhtes // whiche nyhtes hesperus the eue
  sterre hat[h] browt // ?at ?e se gredy to flowen constreyneth with
  a certeyn ende hise floodes / so ?at it is nat l[e]ueful to
  strechche hise brode termes or bowndes vp-on the erthes // ?at is
  to seyn to couere alle the erthe // Al this a-cordaunce of thinges
  is bownden with looue / ?at gouerneth erthe and see / and [he]
  hath also commaundement? to the heuenes / and yif this looue
  slakede the brydelis / alle thinges ?at now louen hem to-gederes /
  wolden maken a batayle contynuely and stryuen to fordoon the
  fasoun of this worlde / the which they now leden in acordable
  feith by fayre moeuynges // this looue halt to-gideres poeples /
  ioygned with an hooly bond / and knytteth sacrement of maryages of
  chaste looues // And loue enditeth lawes to trewe felawes // O
  weleful weere mankynde / yif thilke loue ?at gouerneth heuene
  gouerned yowre corages /.

    (_Chaucer's Boethius_, bk. ii. met. 8.)

  Quod mundus stabili fide
  Concordes variat vices,
  Quod pugnantia semina
  Foedus perpetuum tenent,
  Quod Phoebus roseum diem
  Curru provehit aureo,
  Ut quas duxerit Hesperus
  Phoebe noctibus imperet,
  Ut fluctus avidum mare
  Certo fine coerceat,
  Ne terris liceat vagis
  Latos tundere terminos;
  _Hanc rerum seriem ligat,
  Terras ac pelagus regens,
  Et coelo imperitans amor._
  Hic si fraena remiserit,
  Quicquid nunc amat invicem,
  Bellum continuo geret:
  Et quam nunc socia fide
  Pulcris motibus incitant,
  Certent solvere machinam.
  Hic sancto populos quoque
  Junctos foedere continet,
  Hic et conjugii sacrum
  Castis nectit amoribus,
  Hic fidis etiam sua
  Dictat jura sodalibus.
  O felix hominum genus,
  Si vestros animos amor,
  Quo caelum regitur, regat.

    (_Boeth._, lib. ii. met. 8.)

  Love, that of erth and se hath governaunce!
  Love, that his hestes hath in hevene hye!
  Love, that with an holsom alliaunce
  Halt peples joyned, as hym liste hem gye!
  Love, that knetteth law and compaignye,
  And couples doth in vertu for to dwelle!

    (_Troylus & Cryseyde_, st. 243, vol. iv. p. 296.)

  That, that the world with faith, which that is stable
  Dyverseth so, his stoundes concordynge;--
  That elementz, that ben so discordable,
  Holden a bond, perpetualy durynge;--
  That Phebus mot his rosy carte forth brynge,
  And that the mone hath lordschip overe the nyghte;--
  Al this doth Love, ay heryed be his myght!

  That, that the se, that gredy is to flowen,
  Constreyneth to a certeyn ende so
  Hise flodes, that so fiersly they ne growen
  To drenchen erth and alle for everemo;
  And if that Love aught lete his brydel go,
  Al that now loveth asonder sholde lepe,
  And lost were al that Love halt now to kepe.

    (_Ibid._ st. 244, 245.)


IV. MUTABILITY DIRECTED AND LIMITED BY AN IMMUTABLE AND DIVINE
INTELLIGENCE.

  That same prynce and moevere eek, quod he,
  Hath stabled, in this wrecched world adoun,
  Certeyn dayes and duracioun
  To alle that er engendrid in this place,
  Over the whiche day they may nat pace,
  Al mowe they yit wel here dayes abregge;
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  Than may men wel by this ordre discerne
  That thilke moevere stabul is and eterne.
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  And therfore of his wyse purveaunce
  He hath so wel biset his ordenaunce,
  That spices of thinges and progressiouns
  Schullen endure by successiouns
  And nat eterne be, withoute any lye.

    (_Knightes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 92, 93.)

  ?e engendrynge of alle ?inges quod she and alle ?e progressiouns
  of muuable nature. and alle ?at moeue? in any manere taki? hys
  causes. hys ordre. and hys formes. of ?e stablenesse of ?e deuyne
  ?ou?t [and thilke deuyne thowht] ?at is yset and put in ?e toure.
  ?at is to seyne in ?e hey?t of ?e simplicite of god. stablisi?
  many manere gyses to ?inges ?at ben to don.

    (_Chaucer's Boethius_, bk. iv. pr. 6, p. 134.)


V. THE PART IS DERIVED FROM THE WHOLE, THE IMPERFECT FROM THE PERFECT.

  Wel may men knowe, but it be a fool,
  That every partye dyryveth from his hool.
  For nature hath nat take his bygynnyng
  Of no partye ne cantel of a thing,
  But of a thing that parfyt is and stable,
  Descendyng so, til it be corumpable.

    (_Knightes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 92.)

  For al ?ing ?at is cleped inperfit . is proued inperfit by ?e
  amenusynge of perfeccioun . or of ?ing ?at is perfit . and her-of
  come? it . ?at in euery ?ing general . yif ?at . ?at men seen any
  ?ing ?at is inperfit . certys in ?ilke general ?er mot ben somme
  ?ing ?at is perfit. For yif so be ?at perfeccioun is don awey .
  men may nat ?inke nor seye fro whennes ?ilke ?ing is ?at is cleped
  inperfit . For ?e nature of ?inges ne token nat her bygynnyng of
  ?inges amenused and inperfit . but it procedi? of ?ingus ?at ben
  al hool . and absolut . and descende? so doune in-to outerest
  ?inges and in-to ?ingus empty and wi?-oute fruyt . but as I haue
  shewed a litel her byforne . ?at yif ?er be a blisfulnesse ?at be
  frele and vein and inperfit . ?er may no man doute . ?at ?er nys
  som blisfulnesse ?at is sad stedfast and perfit.'

    (bk. iii. pr. 10, p. 89.)

  Omne enim quod imperfectum esse dicitur, id deminutione perfecti
  imperfectum esse perhibetur. Quo fit ut si in quolibet genere
  imperfectum quid esse videatur, in eo perfectum quoque aliquod
  esse necesse sit. Etenim perfectione sublata, unde illud, quod
  imperfectum perhibetur, extiterit, ne fingi quidem potest. _Neque
  enim ab diminutis inconsummatisque natura rerum cepit exordium,
  sed ab integris absolutisque procedens in haec extrema atque effoeta
  dilabitur._ Quod si, uti paulo ante monstravimus, est quaedam boni
  fragilis imperfecta felicitas, esse aliquam solidam perfectamque
  non potest dubitari.

    (_Boeth._, lib. iii. pr. 10.)


VI. GENTILITY.

  For gentilnesse nys but renome
  Of thin auncestres, for her heigh bounte
  Which is a straunge thing to thy persone.

    (_The Wyf of Bathes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 241.)

  For if ?e name of gentilesse be referred to renoun and clernesse
  of linage. ?an is gentil name but a foreine ?ing.

    (_Chaucer's Boethius_, p. 78.)

  _Quae_ [nobilitas], _si ad claritudinem refertur, aliena est._

    (_Boethius_, lib. iii. pr. 6.)


VII. NERO'S CRUELTY.

  No teer out of his eyen for that sighte
  Ne cam; but sayde, a fair womman was sche.
  Gret wonder is how that he couthe or mighte
  Be domesman on hir dede beaute.

    (_The Monkes Tale_, vol. iii. p. 217.)

  Ne no tere ne wette his face, but he was so hard-herted ?at he
  my?te ben domesman or iuge of hire dede beaute.

    (_Chaucer's Boethius_, p. 55.)

  Ora non tinxit lacrymis, sed esse
  Censor extincti potuit decoris.

    (_Boethius_, lib. ii. met. 6.)


VIII. PREDESTINATION AND FREE-WILL.

In 'Troylus and Cryseyde' we find the following long passage taken from
Boethius, book v. prose 2, 3.

Book iv. st. 134, vol. iv. p. 339.

  (1) Syn God seth every thynge, out of doutaunce,
      And hem disponeth, thorugh his ordinaunce,
      In hire merites sothely for to be,
      As they shul comen by predesteyne

136

  (2) For som men seyn if God seth al byforne,
      Ne God may not deseyved ben parde!
      Than moot it fallen, theigh men hadde it sworne,
      That purveyaunce hath seyn befor to be,
      Wherfor I seye, that, from eterne, if he
      Hathe wiste byforn our thought ek as oure dede,
      We have no fre choys, as thise clerkes rede.

137

  (3) For other thoughte, nor other dede also,
      Myghte nevere ben, but swich as purveyaunce,
      Which may nat ben deceyved nevere moo,
      Hath feled byforne, withouten ignoraunce;
      For if ther myghte ben a variaunce,
      To wrythen out fro Goddes purveyinge,
      Ther nere no prescience of thynge comynge;

138

  (4) But it were rather an opinyon
      Uncertein, and no stedfast forseynge;
      And certes that were an abusyon
      That God shold han no parfit clere wetynge,
      More than we men, that han douteous wenynge,
      But swich an erroure upon God to gesse
      Were fals, and foule, and wikked corsednesse.

139

  (5) They seyn right thus, that thynge is nat to come,
      For that the prescience hath seyne byfore
      That it shal come; but they seyn that therfore
      That it shal come, therfor the purveyaunce
      Woot it bifore, withouten ignorance.

140

  (6) And in this manere this necessite
      Retourneth in his part contrarye agayn;
      For nedfully byhoveth it not to be,
      That thilke thynges fallen in certeyn
      That ben purveyed; but nedly, as they seyne,
      Bihoveth it that thynges, which that falle,
      That thei in certein ben purveied alle.

141

  (7) I mene as though I labourede me in this,
      To enqueren which thynge cause of whiche thynge be;

  (8) As, whether that the prescience of God is
      The certein cause of the necessite
      Of thynges that to comen ben, parde!
      Or, if necessite of thynge comynge
      Be cause certein of the purveyinge.

142

  (9) But now nenforce I me nat in shewynge
      How the ordre of causes stant; but wel woot I
      That it bihoveth that the bifallynge
      Of thynges, wiste bifor certeinly,
      Be necessarie, al seme it nat therby
      That prescience put fallynge necessaire
      To thynge to come, al falle it foule or faire.

143

 (10) For, if ther sit a man yonde on a see, [seat]
      Than by necessite bihoveth it,
      That certes thyn opinioun soth be,
      That wenest or conjectest that he sit;
      And, further over, now ayeinwarde yit,
      Lo right so is it on the part contrarie,
      As thus,--nowe herkene, for I wol nat tarie:--

144

 (11) I sey, that if the opinion of the
      Be soth for that he sit, than seye I this,
      That he moot sitten by necessite;
      And thus necessite in either is,
      For in hym nede of sittynge is, ywis,
      And in the, nede of soth; and thus forsoth
      Ther mot necessite ben in yow bothe.

145

 (12) But thow maist seyne, the man sit nat therfore,
      That thyn opinioun of his sittynge sothe is;
      But rather, for the man sat there byfore,
      Therfor is thyn opinioun soth, ywys;
      And I seye, though the cause of soth of this
      Cometh of his sittynge, yet necessite
      Is interchaunged both in hym and the.

146

 (13) Thus in the same wyse, out of doutaunce,
      I may wel maken, as it semeth me,
      My resonynge of Goddes purveiaunce,
      And of the thynges that to comen be; . . .

147

 (14) For although that for thynge shal come, ywys,
      Therfor it is purveyed certeynly,
      Nat that it cometh for it purveied is;
      Yet, natheles, bihoveth it nedfully,
      That thynge to come be purveied trewly;
      Or elles thynges that purveied be.
      That they bitiden by necessite.

148

 (15) And this sufficeth right ynough, certeyn,
      For to distruye oure fre choys everydele.

  (1) Quae tamen ille ab aeterno cuncta prospiciens providentiae cernit
  intuitus, et suis quaeque meritis praedestinata disponit. . . . .
  (_Boethius_, lib. v. pr. 2.)  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

  (2) Nam si cuncta prospicit Deus neque falli ullo modo potest,
  evenire necesse est, quod providentia futurum esse praeviderit.
  Quare si ab aeterno non facta hominum modo, sed etiam consilia
  voluntatesque praenoscit, nulla erit arbitrii libertas;

  (3) Neque enim vel factum aliud ullum vel quaelibet existere
  poterit voluntas, nisi quam nescia falli providentia divina
  praesenserit. Nam si res aliorsum, quam provisae sunt detorqueri
  valent, non jam erit futuri firma praescientia;

  (4) Sed opinio potius incerta; quod de Deo nefas credere judico.

  (5) Aiunt enim non ideo quid esse eventurum quoniam id providentia
  futurum esse prospexerit; sed e contrario potius, quoniam quid
  futurum est, id divinam providentiam latere non possit.

  (6) Eoque modo necessarium est hoc in contrariam relabi partem;
  neque enim necesse est contingere quae providentur, sed necesse est
  quae futura sunt provideri.

  (7) Quasi vero quae cujusque rei causa sit,

  (8) Praescientiane futurorum necessitatis an futurorum necessitas
  providentiae, laboretur.

  (9) At nos illud demonstrare nitamur, quoquo modo sese habeat ordo
  causarum, necessarium esse eventum praescitarum rerum, etiam si
  praescientia futuris rebus eveniendi necessitatem non videatur
  inferre.

  (10) Etenim si quispiam sedeat, opinionem quae eum sedere conjectat
  veram esse necesse est: at e converso rursus,

  (11) Si de quopiam vera sit opinio quoniam sedet eum sedere
  necesse est. In utroque igitur necessitas inest: in hoc quidem
  sedendi, at vero in altero veritatis.

  (12) Sed non idcirco quisque sedet, quoniam vera est opinio: sed
  haec potius vera est, quoniam quempiam sedere praecessit. Ita cum
  causa veritatis ex altera parte procedat, inest tamen communis in
  utraque necessitas.

  (13) Similia de providentia futurisque rebus ratiocinari patet.

  (14) Nam etiam si idcirco, quoniam futura sunt, providentur: non
  vero ideo, quoniam providentur, eveniunt: nihilo minus tamen a Deo
  vel ventura provideri, vel provisa evenire necesse est:

  (15) Quod ad perimendam arbitrii libertatem solum satis est.

    (lib. v. pr. 3.)

See _Chaucer's Boethius_, pp. 154-6.


IX. THE GRIEF OF REMEMBERING BYGONE HAPPINESS.

  For, of fortunes scharp adversite,
  The worste kynde of infortune is this,
  A man to han ben in prosperite,
  And it remembren, when it passed is.

     (_Troylus and Cryseyde_, bk. iii. st. 226, vol. iv. p. 291.)

  Sed hoc est, quod recolentem me vehementius coquit. Nam in omni
  adversitate fortunae infelicissimum genus est infortunii, fuisse
  felicem.[I-10]

    (_Boethius_, lib. ii. pr. 4.)

    [Footnote I-10: Cf. Dante, _Inferno_, V. 121.

    (_Ib._ p. 33.)

In book v., stanza 260, vol. v. p. 75, Chaucer describes how the soul of
Hector, after his death, ascended 'up to the holughnesse of the seventhe
spere.' In so doing he seems to have had before him met. 1, book 4, of
Boethius, where the 'soul' is described as passing into the heaven's
utmost sphere, and looking down on the world below. See _Chaucer's
Boethius_, p. 110, 111.

AEtas Prima is of course a metrical version of lib. ii. met. 5.

Hampole speaks of the wonderful sight of the Lynx; perhaps he was
indebted to Boethius for the hint. --(See _Boethius_, book 3, pr. 8,
p. 81.)

I have seen the following elsewhere:

  (1) Value not beauty, for it may be destroyed by a three days'
  fever.

    (See _Chaucer's Boethius_, p. 81.)

  (2) There is no greater plague than the enmity of thy familiar
  friend.

    (See _Chaucer's_ translation, p. 77.)

       *       *       *       *       *

Chaucer did not English Boethius second-hand, through any early French
version, as some have supposed, but made his translation with the Latin
original before him.

Jean de Meung's version, the only early French translation, perhaps,
accessible to Chaucer, is not always literal, while the present
translation is seldom free or periphrastic, but conforms closely to the
Latin, and is at times awkwardly literal. A few passages, taken
haphazard, will make this sufficiently clear.

  _Et dolor aetatem jussit inesse suam._ And sorou ha? comaunded his

Many of the above examples are very bald renderings of the original, and
are only quoted here to show that Chaucer did not make his translation
from the French.

Chaucer is not always felicitous in his translations:--thus he
translates _clavus atque gubernaculum_ by _keye and a stiere_ (p. 103),
and _compendium_ (gain, acquisition) by _abreggynge_ (abridging,
curtailment), p. 151. Many terms make their appearance in English for
the first time,--and most of them have become naturalized, and are such
as we could ill spare. Some few are rather uncommon, as _gouernaile_
(gubernaculum), p. 27; _arbitre_ (arbitrium), p. 154. As Chaucer takes
the trouble to explain _inestimable_ (inaestimabilis), p. 158, it could
not have been a very familiar term.

Our translator evidently took note of various readings, for on p. 31 he
notes a variation of the original. On p. 51 he uses _armurers_
(= armures) to render _arma_, though most copies agree in reading
_arva_.

There are numerous glosses and explanations of particular passages,
which seem to be interpolated by Chaucer himself. Thus he explains what
is meant by the _heritage of Socrates_ (p. 10, 11); he gives the
meaning of _coemption_ (p. 15); of _Euripus_ (p. 33); of the _porch_
(p. 166).[I-11] Some of his definitions are very quaint; as, for
instance, that of Tragedy--'_a dite of a prosperite for a tyme ?at endi?
in wrechednesse_' (p. 35). One would think that the following definition
of Tragedian would be rather superfluous after this,--'_a maker of dites
?at hy?ten_ (are called) _tregedies_' (p. 77).

  _Melliflui . . . oris Homerus_

is thus quaintly Englished: _Homer wi? ?e hony mou?e, ?at is to seyn.
homer wi? ?e swete dites_ (p. 153).

       *       *       *       *       *

The present translation of the _De Consolatione_ is taken from
Additional MS. 10,340, which is supposed to be the _oldest_ manuscript
that exists in our public libraries. After it was all copied out and
ready for press, Mr Bradshaw was kind enough to procure me, for the
purpose of collation, the loan of the Camb. University MS. Ii. 3. 21,
from which the various readings at the foot of the pages are taken.

Had I had an opportunity of examining the Cambridge MS. carefully
throughout before the work was so far advanced, I should certainly have
selected it in preference to the text now given to the reader. Though
not so ancient as the British Museum MS., it is far more correct in its
grammatical inflexions, and is no doubt a copy of an older and very
accurate text.

The Additional MS. is written by a scribe who was unacquainted with the
force of the final _-e_. Thus he adds it to the preterites of strong
verbs, which do not require it; he omits it in the preterites of weak
verbs where it is wanted, and attaches it to passive participles (of
weak verbs), where it is superfluous. The scribe of the Cambridge MS. is
careful to preserve the final _-e_ where it is a sign (1) of the
definite declension of the adjective; (2) of the plural adjective;
(3) of the infinitive mood; (4) of the preterite of weak verbs; (5) of
present participles;[I-12] (6) of the 2nd pers. pret. indic. of strong
verbs; (7) of adverbs; (8) of an older vowel ending.

The Addit. MS. has frequently _thilk_ (singular and plural), and _-nes_
(in _wrechednes_, &c.), when the Camb. MS. has _thilke_[I-13] and
_-nesse_.

For further differences the reader may consult the numerous collations
at the foot of the page.

If the Chaucer Society obtains that amount of patronage from the
literary public which it deserves, but unfortunately has yet not
succeeded in getting, so that it may be enabled to go on with the great
work which has been so successfully commenced, then the time may come
when I shall have the opportunity of editing the Camb. MS. of Chaucer's
Boethius for that Society, and lovers of Early English Literature will
have two texts instead of one.

    159.]

    [Footnote I-12: In the Canterbury Tales we find participles in
    _-ynge_.]

    [Footnote I-13: It is nearly always _thilke_ in the Canterbury
    Tales.]




APPENDIX TO INTRODUCTION.


The last of the ancients, and one who forms a link between the classical
period of literature and that of the middle ages, in which he was a
favourite author, is Boethius, a man of fine genius, and interesting
both from his character and his death. It is well known that after
filling the dignities of Consul and Senator in the court of Theodoric,
he fell a victim to the jealousy of a sovereign, from whose memory, in
many respects glorious, the stain of that blood has never been effaced.
The _Consolation of Philosophy_, the chief work of Boethius, was written
in his prison. Few books are more striking from the circumstances of
their production. Last of the classic writers, in style not impure,
though displaying too lavishly that poetic exuberance which had
distinguished the two or three preceding centuries, in elevation of
sentiment equal to any of the philosophers, and mingling a Christian
sanctity with their lessons, he speaks from his prison in the swan-like
tones of dying eloquence. The philosophy that consoled him in bonds, was
soon required in the sufferings of a cruel death. Quenched in his blood,
the lamp he had trimmed with a skilful hand gave no more light; the
language of Tully and Virgil soon ceased to be spoken; and many ages
were to pass away, before learned diligence restored its purity, and the
union of genius with imitation taught a few modern writers to surpass in
eloquence the Latinity of Boethius. --(Hallam's _Literature of Europe_,
i. 2, 4th ed. 1854.)

The Senator Boethius is the last of the Romans whom Cato or Tully could
have acknowledged for their countryman. As a wealthy orphan, he
inherited the patrimony and honours of the Anician family, a name
ambitiously assumed by the kings and emperors of the age; and the
appellation of Manlius asserted his genuine or fabulous descent from a
race of consuls and dictators, who had repulsed the Gauls from the
Capitol, and sacrificed their sons to the discipline of the Republic. In
the youth of Boethius the studies of Rome were not totally abandoned; a
Virgil is now extant, corrected by the hand of a consul; and the
professors of grammar, rhetoric, and jurisprudence, were maintained in
their privileges and pensions by the liberality of the Goths. But the
erudition of the Latin language was insufficient to satiate his ardent
curiosity; and Boethius is said to have employed eighteen laborious
years in the schools of Athens, which were supported by the zeal, the
learning, and the diligence of Proclus and his disciples. The reason and
piety of their Roman pupil were fortunately saved from the contagion of
mystery and magic, which polluted the groves of the Academy, but he
imbibed the spirit, and imitated the method, of his dead and living
masters, who attempted to reconcile the strong and subtle sense of
Aristotle with the devout contemplation and sublime fancy of Plato.
After his return to Rome, and his marriage with the daughter of his
friend, the patrician Symmachus, Boethius still continued, in a palace
of ivory and [glass] to prosecute the same studies. The Church was
edified by his profound defence of the orthodox creed against the Arian,
the Eutychian, and the Nestorian heresies; and the Catholic unity was
explained or exposed in a formal treatise by the _indifference_ of three
distinct though consubstantial persons. For the benefit of his Latin
readers, his genius submitted to teach the first elements of the arts
and sciences of Greece. The geometry of Euclid, the music of Pythagoras,
the arithmetic of Nicomachus, the mechanics of Archimedes, the astronomy
of Ptolemy, the theology of Plato, and the logic of Aristotle, with the
commentary of Porphyry, were translated and illustrated by the
indefatigable pen of the Roman senator. And he alone was esteemed
capable of describing the wonders of art, a sun-dial, a water-clock, or
a sphere which represented the motions of the planets. From these
abstruse speculations, Boethius stooped, or, to speak more truly, he
rose to the social duties of public and private life: the indigent were
relieved by his liberality; and his eloquence, which flattery might
compare to the voice of Demosthenes or Cicero, was uniformly exerted in
the cause of innocence and humanity. Such conspicuous merit was felt and
rewarded by a discerning prince: the dignity of Boethius was adorned
with the titles of consul and patrician, and his talents were usefully
employed in the important station of master of the offices.
Notwithstanding the equal claims of the East and West, his two sons were
created, in their tender youth, the consuls of the same year. On the
memorable day of their inauguration, they proceeded in solemn pomp from
their palace to the forum amidst the applause of the senate and people;
and their joyful father, the true Consul of Rome, after pronouncing an
oration in the praise of his royal benefactor, distributed a triumphal
largess in the games of the circus. Prosperous in his fame and fortunes,
in his public honours and private alliances, in the cultivation of
science and the consciousness of virtue, Boethius might have been styled
happy, if that precarious epithet could be safely applied before the
last term of the life of man.

A philosopher, liberal of his wealth and parsimonious of his time, might
be insensible to the common allurements of ambition, the thirst of gold
and employment. And some credit may be due to the asseveration of
Boethius, that he had reluctantly obeyed the divine Plato, who enjoins
every virtuous citizen to rescue the state from the usurpation of vice
and ignorance. For the integrity of his public conduct he appeals to the
memory of his country. His authority had restrained the pride and
oppression of the royal officers, and his eloquence had delivered
Paulianus from the dogs of the palace. He had always pitied, and often
relieved, the distress of the provincials, whose fortunes were exhausted
by public and private rapine; and Boethius alone had courage to oppose
the tyranny of the Barbarians, elated by conquest, excited by avarice,
and, as he complains, encouraged by impunity. In these honourable
contests his spirit soared above the consideration of danger, and
perhaps of prudence; and we may learn from the example of Cato, that a
character of pure and inflexible virtue is the most apt to be misled by
prejudice, to be heated by enthusiasm, and to confound private enmities
with public justice. The disciple of Plato might exaggerate the
infirmities of nature, and the imperfections of society; and the mildest
form of a Gothic kingdom, even the weight of allegiance and gratitude,
must be insupportable to the free spirit of a Roman patriot. But the
favour and fidelity of Boethius declined in just proportion with the
public happiness; and an unworthy colleague was imposed to divide and
control the power of the master of the offices. In the last gloomy
season of Theodoric, he indignantly felt that he was a slave; but as his
master had only power over his life, he stood without arms and without
fear against the face of an angry Barbarian, who had been provoked to
believe that the safety of the senate was incompatible with his own. The
Senator Albinus was accused and already convicted on the presumption of
_hoping_, as it was said, the liberty of Rome.

"If Albinus be criminal," exclaimed the orator, "the senate and myself
are all guilty of the same crime. If we are innocent, Albinus is equally
entitled to the protection of the laws." These laws might not have
punished the simple and barren wish of an unattainable blessing; but
they would have shown less indulgence to the rash confession of
Boethius, that, had he known of a conspiracy, the tyrant never should.
The advocate of Albinus was soon involved in the danger and perhaps the
guilt of his client; their signature (which they denied as a forgery)
was affixed to the original address, inviting the emperor to deliver
Italy from the Goths; and three witnesses of honourable rank, perhaps of
infamous reputation, attested the treasonable designs of the Roman
patrician. Yet his innocence must be presumed, since he was deprived by
Theodoric of the means of justification, and rigorously confined in the
tower of Pavia, while the senate, at the distance of five hundred miles,
pronounced a sentence of confiscation and death against the most
illustrious of its members. At the command of the Barbarians, the occult
science of a philosopher was stigmatized with the names of sacrilege and
magic. A devout and dutiful attachment to the senate was condemned as
criminal by the trembling voices of the senators themselves; and their
ingratitude deserved the wish or prediction of Boethius, that, after
him, none should be found guilty of the same offence.

While Boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected each moment the
sentence or the stroke of death, he composed in the tower of Pavia the
_Consolation of Philosophy_; a golden volume not unworthy of the leisure
of Plato or Tully, but which claims incomparable merit from the
barbarism of the times and the situation of the author. The celestial
guide, whom he had so long invoked at Rome and Athens, now condescended
to illumine his dungeon, to revive his courage, and to pour into his
wounds her salutary balm. She taught him to compare his long prosperity
and his recent distress, and to conceive new hopes from the inconstancy
of fortune. Reason had informed him of the precarious condition of her
gifts; experience had satisfied him of their real value; he had enjoyed
them without guilt; he might resign them without a sigh, and calmly
disdain the impotent malice of his enemies, who had left him happiness,
since they had left him virtue. From the earth, Boethius ascended to
heaven in search of the SUPREME GOOD; explored the metaphysical
labyrinth of chance and destiny, of prescience and free-will, of time
and eternity; and generously attempted to reconcile the perfect
attributes of the Deity with the apparent disorders of his moral and
physical government. Such topics of consolation, so obvious, so vague,
or so abstruse, are ineffectual to subdue the feelings of human nature.
Yet the sense of misfortune may be diverted by the labour of thought;
and the sage who could artfully combine in the same work the various
riches of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, must already have possessed
the intrepid calmness which he affected to seek. Suspense, the worst of
evils, was at length determined by the ministers of death, who executed,
and perhaps exceeded, the inhuman mandate of Theodoric. A strong cord
was fastened round the head of Boethius, and forcibly tightened till his
eyes almost started from their sockets; and some mercy may be discovered
in the milder torture of beating him with clubs till he expired. But his
genius survived to diffuse a ray of knowledge over the darkest ages of
the Latin world; the writings of the philosopher were translated by the
most glorious of the English kings, and the third emperor of the name of
Otho removed to a more honourable tomb the bones of a Catholic saint,
who, from his Arian persecutors, had acquired the honours of martyrdom
and the fame of miracles. In the last hours of Boethius, he derived some
comfort from the safety of his two sons, of his wife, and of his
father-in-law, the venerable Symmachus. But the grief of Symmachus was
indiscreet, and perhaps disrespectful; he had presumed to lament, he
might dare to revenge, the death of an injured friend. He was dragged in
chains from Rome to the palace of Ravenna; and the suspicions of
Theodoric could only be appeased by the blood of an innocent and aged
senator.--Gibbon's _Decline and Fall_, 1838, vol. vii. p. 45-52 (without
the notes).

    [Sidenote: _P._ All the things above-mentioned must be tried by
    Good, as the rule and square.]

          ?is is ope{n} {and} clere q{uo}d she. ?at alle o?er
  ?inges ben referred {and} brou?t to goode.

    [Sidenote: Sufficiency, power, &c., are all desired, because they
    are esteemed a good.]

          ? For ?erfore
  is suffisaunce requered. For it is demed to ben
  good. {and} for?i is power requered. for men trowen also          2608
  ?at it be goode. and ?is same ?ing mowe we ?inken {and}
  coueiten of reuerence {and} of noblesse {and} of delit.

    [Sidenote: Good is the cause why all things are desired.]

  ?an is souereyne good ?e soume {and} ?e cause of alle ?at
  au?t[e] be desired.

    [Sidenote: For that which contains no good, either in reality or
    appearance, can never be desired.]

          forwhi ?ilke ?ing ?at wi?-holde? no                       2612
  good in it self ne semblaunce of goode it ne may nat
  wel in no manere be desired ne requered.

    [Sidenote: On the contrary, things not essentially good are
    desired because they appear to be real goods.]

          {and} ?e contrarie.
  For ?ou? ?at ?inges by hir nature ne ben nat
  goode algates yif men wene ?at ?ei be{n} goode ?it ben            2616
  ?ei desired as ?ou? [?{a}t] ?ei were verrayly goode.

    [Sidenote: Hence, Good is esteemed as the cause and end of all
    things that we desire.]

  {and} ?erfore is it ?at men au?te{n} to wene by ry?t ?at bounte
  be souereyne fyn {and} ?e cause of alle ?inges ?at ben to
  requeren.

    [Sidenote: That which is the cause of our desiring any thing is
    itself what we chiefly want.]

          ? But certis ?ilke ?{a}t is cause for whiche              2620
  men requeren any ?ing. ? it seme? ?at ?ilke same
  ?ing be most desired.

    [Sidenote: If a man desire to ride on account of health--it is not
    the ride he wants so much as its salutary effects.]

          as ?us yif ?at a wy?t wolde ryde
  for cause of hele. he ne desire? nat so mychel ?e
  moeuyng to ryden as ?e effect of his heele.                  [[pg 94]]

    [Sidenote: Since all things are sought after for the sake of Good,
    they cannot be more desirable than the good itself.]

          Now ?an                                                   2624
  syn ?at alle ?inges ben requered for ?e grace of good.
  ?ei ne ben [nat] desired of alle folk more ?an ?e same
  good

    [Sidenote: It has been shown that all the aforesaid things are
    only pursued for the sake of happiness--hence it is clear that
    good and happiness are essentially the same.]

          ? But we han graunted ?at blysfulnesse is ?at
  ?ing for whiche ?at alle ?ise o?er ?inges ben desired.            2628
  ?an is it ?us ?at certis only blisfulnesse is requered {and}
  desired ? By whiche ?ing it shewe? clerely ?at good
  {and} blisfulnesse is al oone {and} ?e same substaunce.

    [Sidenote: _B._ I see no cause to differ from you.]

  ? I se nat q{uo}d I wher fore ?at men my?t[en] discorden          2632
  in ?is.

    [Sidenote: _P._ It has been proved that God and happiness are
    identical and inseparable.]

          _p._ {and} we han shewed ?at god {and} verrey blysfulnesse
  is al oon ?ing

    [Sidenote: _B._ That is true.]

          ? ?at is so?e q{uod} .I.

    [Sidenote: Therefore the substance of God is also the same as that
    of the Supreme Good.]

  ?an mowe we conclude sikerly ?{a}t ?e substaunce of god is
  set in ?ilke same good {and} in noon o?er place.                  2636

    [Sidenote: Happy is he that hath seen the lucid spring of truth!
    Happy the man that hath freed himself from terrestrial chains!]

  ++Blisful is ?at man ?at may seen ?e clere welle of good.
  blisful is he ?at may vnbynde hym fro ?e bonde of

    [Sidenote: The Thracian poet, consumed with grief for the loss of
    his wife, sought relief from music.]

          ? ?e poete of t{ra}ce [orphe{us}] ?at somtyme
  hadde ry?t greet sorowe for ?e dee? of hys wijf.

    [Sidenote: His mournful songs drew the woods along; the rolling
    rivers ceased to flow; the savage beasts became heedless of their
    prey; the timid hare was not aghast at the hound.]

          aftir ?at                                                 3024

  {and} had[de] maked ?at ?e hare was nat agast of ?e
  hounde whiche ?at was plesed by hys songe.

    [Sidenote: But the songs that did all things tame, could not allay
    their master's ardent love.]

          so ?at

  entrailes of his brest. ne ?e songes ?at hadde ouer         [[pg 107]]

    [Sidenote: He bewailed the cruelty of the gods above, and
    descended to Pluto's realm.]

          ? He pleyned[e] hym of ?e godes ?at were{n}
  cruel to hym. he wente hym to ?e houses of helle

    [Sidenote: There he struck his tuneful strings and sang,
    exhausting all the harmonious art imparted to him by his mother
    Calliope.]

  {and} ?ere he tempred[e] hys blaundissyng songes by resounyng     3036
  of hys strenges. ? And spak {and} song in
  wepynge alle ?at euer he hadde resceyued {and} laued

    [Sidenote: In songs dictated both by grief and love, he implored
    the infernal powers to give him back his Eurydice.]

  {and} he song wi? as mychel as he my?t[e] of                      3040

    [Sidenote: Cerberus, Hell's three-headed porter, stood amazed;]

  ? Cerberus ?e porter of helle wi? his ?re heuedes was
  cau?t {and} al abaist for ?e new[e] songe.

    [Sidenote: the Furies, tormentors of guilty souls, did weep;]

    [Sidenote: Tantalus, suffering from a long and raging thirst,
    despised the stream;]

*INCIPIT LIBER QUARTUS.


HEC CUM PHILOSOPHIA DIGNITATE UULT{US}.

  [Sidenote: [The 1^ma p{ro}se.]]

    [Sidenote: When P. with grace and dignity had poured forth her
    songs, I, not quite quit of my load of grief, interrupted her as
    she was continuing her discourse.]

  ++Whanne philosophie hadde songe{n} softly {and} delitably
  ?e forseide ?inges kepynge ?e dignitee of hir
  choere in ?e wey?te of hir wordes. I ?an ?at ne hadde             3080
  nat al out{er}ly for?eten ?e wepyng {and} mournyng
  ?at was set in myne herte for-brek ?e entenc{i}ou{n} of hir
  ?at entended[e] ?itte to seyne o?{er} ?inges.

    [Sidenote: All your discourses, O my conductress to the true
    light! have been very clear and unanswerable, both by the divine
    testimony which they carry along with them, and by thy
    irrefragable arguments.]

          ? Se q{uo}d
  I. ?ou ?at art gideresse of verray ly?te ?e ?inges ?at ?ou        3084
  hast seid [me] hider to ben to me so clere
                  {and} so shewyng                            [[pg 109]]
  by ?e deuyne lokyng of hem {and} by ?i resou{n}s ?at
  ?ei ne mowe nat ben ouercomen.

    [Sidenote: Through the oppression of grief I had forgotten these
    truths, but was not wholly ignorant of them.]

          ? And ?ilke ?i{n}g{us}
  ?at ?ou toldest me. al be it so ?at I hadde som tyme              3088
  fo[r]?eten hem for [the] sorwe of ?e wronge ?at ha? ben
  don to me. ?it na?eles ?ei ne were nat alouterly vnknowen
  to me.

    [Sidenote: The principal cause of my trouble is this--that, whilst
    the absolute Ruler of all things is goodness itself, evil exists
    and is allowed to pass unpunished.]

          but ?is same is namly a gret cause of
  my sorwe. ?at so as ?e gouernoure of ?inges is goode.             3092
  yif ?at yuelys mowen ben by any weyes. or ellys yif
  ?at yuelys passen wi? outen punyssheinge.

    [Sidenote: This, to say the least, is astonishing.]

          ?e whiche
  ?inge oonly how wor?i it is to ben wondred vpon. ?ou
  considerest it weel ?i self certeynly.

    [Sidenote: Moreover, while _vice_ flourishes _virtue_ is not only
    unrewarded, but trampled under foot by base and profligate men,
    and suffers the punishment due to impiety.]

          but ?itte to ?is                                          3096
  ?ing ?ere is an o?er ?ing y-ioigned more to ben ywondred
  vpon. ? For felonie is emperisse {and} flowre? ful of
  rycchesse. and vertues nis nat al oonly wi? outen medes.
  but it is cast vndir {and} fortroden vndir ?e feet of felonous    3100
  folk. {and} it abie? ?e to{ur}me{n}tes in sted of
  wicked felou{n}s

    [Sidenote: Here is cause for wonderment, since such things are
    possible under the government of an omniscient and omnipotent God,
    who wills nothing but what is the best.]

          ? Of al[le] whiche ?ing ?er nis no wy?t
  ?at [may] merueyllen ynou? ne compleyne ?at swiche
  ?inges ben don in ?e regne of god ?at alle ?inges woot.           3104
  and alle ?inges may {and} ne wool nat but only goode
  ?inges.

    [Sidenote: _P._ It were indeed, not only marvellous, but also
    horribly monstrous, if, in the well-regulated family of so great a
    master, the worthless vessels should be honoured and the precious
    ones be despised:--but it is not so.]

          ? ?an seide she ?us. certys q{uo}d she ?at were
  a grete meruayle {and} an enbaissynge wi?outen ende.
  {and} wel more horrible ?an alle monstres yif it were as          3108
  ?{o}u wenest. ?at is to sein. ?at in ?e ry?t ordeyne house
  of so mochel a fader {and} an ordenour of meyne. ?at ?e
  vesseles ?at ben foule {and} vyle sholde ben hono{ur}ed
  {and} heried. and ?e p{re}cious uesseles sholde ben defouled      3112
  {and} vyle. but it nis nat so.

    [Sidenote: For if the conclusions we have come to, be sound and
    irrefragable, we must confess that under God's rule the _good_ are
    always powerful and mighty, and the _wicked_ weak and
    contemptible;]

          For yif ?e ?inges
  ?at I haue co{n}cluded a litel here byforne ben kept hoole  [[pg 110]]
  {and} vnraced. ?ou shalt wel knowe by ?e auctorite of
  god. of ?e whos regne I speke ?at certys ?e good[e]               3116
  folk ben alwey my?ty. {and} shrewes ben alwey yuel {and}
  feble.

    [Sidenote: that vice never passes unpunished, nor virtue goes
    unrewarded;]

          ne ?e vices ben neu{e}re mo wi? outen peyne[;] ne
  ?e vertues ne ben nat wi? outen mede.

    [Sidenote: that happiness attends good men, and misfortune falls
    to the lot of the wicked.]

          and ?at blisfulnesses
  comen alwey to goode folke. {and} infortune come?                 3120
  alwey to wicked folke.

    [Sidenote: These and many other truths of like nature shall be
    proved to thee, and shall put an end to thy complaints, and
    strengthen thee with firmness and solidity.]

          ? And ?ou shalt wel knowe
  many[e] ?inges of ?is kynde ?{a}t sholle cessen ?i pleyntes.
  {and} stedfast ?e wi? stedfast saddenesse.

    [Sidenote: Having shown you a picture of true felicity, and
    wherein it resides, I shall now trace out the way which will lead
    you to your home.]

          ? And for ?ou
  hast seyn ?e forme of ?e verray blisfulnesse by me ?at            3124
  [haue] somtyme I-shewed it ?e. And ?ou hast knowen

  ?e. ?e weye ?at shal brynge ?e a?eyne vnto ?i house               3128

    [Sidenote: I will give your soul wings to soar aloft, so that all
    tribulation being removed, you may, under my guiding, by my road,
    and with my vehicle, return whole and sound into your own
    country.]

  {and} I shal ficche fe?eres in ?i ?ou?t by whiche it may

    THE REWARD OF THE GOOD.]

    [Sidenote: If a man pride himself on the possession of an
    advantage received from another, he may be deprived of it, either
    by the giver or by others.]

  but yif ?at any wy?t reioise? hem of goodnesse ?at ?ei

  hym self. certys he ?at ?af hym ?ilke goodnesse or
  ellys som o?er wy?t my?t[e] bynym[e] it hym.

    [Sidenote: But, as the reward of the virtuous is derived from
    virtue, a man cannot lose this meed unless he ceases to be
    virtuous.]

  mede whan he forleti? to ben good.

    [Sidenote: Lastly, since a reward is desired because it is
    supposed to be a good, can we believe that he who is capable of
    good is deprived of the recompence?]

          {and} at ?e laste so
  as alle medes be{n} requered for men wenen ?at ?ei ben
  good[e]. who is he ?at wolde deme ?at he ?at is ry?t        [[pg 120]]

    [Sidenote: What reward shall he receive?]

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 27.]]

          *{and} of what
  mede shal he be gerdoned.

    [Sidenote: Certainly the fairest and richest of all rewards.]

          certys of ry?t faire mede
  {and} ry?t greet abouen alle medes.

    [Sidenote: Call to mind that excellent corollary I have already
    given thee, and reason thus:--]

  ?ilk noble corolarie ?at I ?af ?e a lytel here byforne.           3412
  {and} gadre it to gidre in ?is manere.

    [Sidenote: Since the supreme good is happiness, it follows that
    all good men are happy in as much as they are good; but if they
    are happy they must become as it were gods.]

          so as god hym self
  is blisfulnesse. ?an is it clere {and} certeyn. ?at alle good
  folk ben makid blisful for ?ei ben good[e]. and ?ilke
  folk ?at ben blisful it accordi? {and} is couenable to ben        3416

    [Sidenote: The reward (_i. e._ divinity) of the righteous is such
    that no time can impair it, no power can diminish it, nor can any
    wickedness obscure it.]

          ?an is ?e mede of goode folk swiche. ?at no
  day [ne] shal enpeyren it. ne no wickednesse shal endirken
  it. ne power of no wy?t ne shal nat amenusen it
  ?at is to seyn to ben maked goddes.

    [Sidenote: Since, then, happiness belongs to good men, punishment
    inseparably attends the wicked.]

    _rewards_ and _punishments_.]

    [Sidenote: It is evident that rewards follow good actions, and

    [Sidenote: You have been taught that _unity_ is essential to being
    and is good--and all that have this unity are good; whatsoever,
    then, fails to be good ceases to exist.]

          ? For ?ou hast lerned a litel                             3440

    [Sidenote: I want you to see that the power of the wicked is in
    reality nothing, that the wicked never go unpunished; that their
    licence to do evil is not of long duration, and that the wicked
    would be more unhappy if it were longer, and infinitely wretched
    if it were to continue for ever.]

    having escaped punishment, than if justly chastised.]

          {and} after
  ?is I haue shewed ?e ?at more vnsely ben shrewes

    [Sidenote: _B._ Your reasoning appears convincing and conclusive.
    But your arguments are opposed to current opinions, and would
    hardly command assent, or even a hearing.]

    [Sidenote: Destiny or Fate is that inherent state or condition of
    movable things by means whereof Providence retains them in the
    order in which she has placed them.]

          but destine is ?e disposic{i}ou{n} {and} ordenaunce

    [Sidenote: Providence embraces all things, although diverse and
    infinite; but Fate gives motion to every individual thing, and in
    the place and under the form appropriated to it.]

  ? For p{ur}ueaunce enbrace? alle ?i{n}ges to hepe. al ?ou? ?at

    [Sidenote: So that the explication of this order of things wrapt

    according to time and other circumstances, may be called Fate.]

    [Sidenote: Though these things appear to differ, yet one of them
    depends on the other, for the order of Fate proceeds from the
    unity of Providence.]

    of a work which he is desirous to finish, executes it afterwards,

    round which the outward ones revolve;]

    [Sidenote: whilst the outermost, revolving in a wider
    circumference, the further it is from the centre describes a
    larger space--but yet, if this circle or anything else be joined
    to the middle point, it is constrained to be immovable.]

          ? and ?ilke ?at is outerest compased by                   3916

  ?at noma{n} dar confesse{n} it ne byknowen it.

    [Sidenote: _P._ Why so? The wise man ought not to be cast down,
    when he has to wage war with Fortune, no more than the valiant man
    ought to be dismayed on hearing the noise of the battle.]

          ? whi so
  q{uo}d she.

    glory, and the difficulties of the other aid him to confirm and
    improve his wisdom.]

  hys sapience. ?at is to seine ?e asprenesse of hys estat.

    [Sidenote: Thus virtue, in its literal acceptation, is a power
    that, relying on its own strength, overcomes all obstacles.]

  ? For ?erfore is it called uertue. for ?at it susteni? {and}      4220

    it corrupt you.]

    felicity.]

    [Sidenote: The choice of fortune lies in your own hands, but
    remember that even adverse fortune, unless it exercises the
    virtues of the good or chastises the wicked, is a punishment.]

          ? For it is set in ?our{e} hand.

    [Sidenote: _B._ Thy exhortation is just and worthy of thy

  ?at hap is bytidynge y-brou?t for?e by foelyshe

    [Sidenote: _P._ So often as a man does anything for the sake of
    any other thing, and another thing than what he intended to do is
    produced by other causes, that thing so produced is called
    _Chance_.]

          ? As ofte q{uo}d she as men don any ?ing for

  it is ycleped hap{pe}.

    [Sidenote: As if a man trench the ground for tillage and find
    gold, then this is believed to happen by chance, although it is
    not so.]

          ? Ry?t as a man dalf ?e er?e by

  it ha? hys p{ro}pre causes of whiche causes ?e cours vnforseyn
  and vnwar semi? to han maked hap{pe}.

    [Sidenote: For if the tiller had not ploughed the field, and if
    the hider of the gold had not concealed it in that spot, the gold
    had not been found.]

          ? For
  yif ?e tilier in ?e er?e ne delue nat in ?e felde. and yif        4352
  ?e hider of ?e golde ne hadde hidd ?e golde in ?ilke
  place. ?e golde ne had[de] nat ben founde.

    [Sidenote: These, then, are the causes of a fortuitous acquisition
    which proceeds from a conflux of encountering causes, and not from
    the intention of the doer.]

          ?ise ben

    [Sidenote: For neither the hider of the gold nor the husbandman
    intended or understood that the gold should be found.]

          ? For nei?er ?e hider of ?e gold.
  ne ?e deluer of ?e felde ne vndirstanden nat ?at ?e

    [Sidenote: But it happened by the concurrence of these two causes
    that the one did dig where the other had hidden the money.]

    of causes, following an action designed for a particular purpose.]

  gretly ?at god knowe? byforn alle ?inges. {and}
  ?at ?er is any fredom of liberte.

    [Sidenote: If God from eternity doth foreknow not only the works,
    but the designs and wills of men, there can be no liberty of
    will--nor can there be any other action or will than that which a
    Divine and infallible Providence hath foreseen.]

    [Sidenote: For if things fall out contrary to such foreseeing, and
    are wrested another way, the prescience of God in regard to
    futurity would not be sure and unerring--it would be nothing but
    an uncertain opinion of them: but I take it to be impious and
    unlawful to believe this of God.]

    [Sidenote: Nor do I approve of the reasoning made use of by some.
    For they say that a thing is not necessarily to happen because God
    hath foreseen it, but rather because it is to happen it cannot be
    hid from the divine Providence.]

    [Sidenote: Now by this reason necessity appears to change sides.
    For it is not necessary that the things which are foreseen should
    happen, but it is necessary that the things which are to befall
    should be foreseen.]

    to fall out.]

    [Sidenote: In both cases there is a necessity--in the latter that
    the person sits--in the former, that the opinion concerning the
    other is true.]

          ? ?an
  is here necessite in ?at oon {and} in ?{a}t o?er. for in ?at      4484
  oon is necessite of sittynge.

    [Sidenote: But the man does not sit because the opinion of his
    sitting is true, but the opinion is true because the action of his
    being seated was antecedent in time.]

    sitting, there is a common necessity in both.]

    [Sidenote: For allowing things are foreseen because they are to
    happen, and that they do not befall because they are foreseen, it
    is necessary that future events should be foreseen of God, or if
    foreseen that they should happen; and this alone is sufficient to
    destroy all idea of _free-will_.]

    [Sidenote: But it is preposterous to make the happening of
    temporal things the cause of eternal prescience, which we do in
    imagining that God foresees future events because they are to
    happen.]

          ? But now                                                 4500

    [Sidenote: The cause of this mystery is that the human
    understanding cannot conceive the simplicity of the divine
    prescience, for if it were possible to comprehend this, every
    difficulty would at once disappear.]

  ? And ?e cause of ?is derkenesse {and} [of this] difficulte

    are foreknown must of necessity happen?]

  for ne drawest ?ou nat argumentes from ellys

    things, must not the issue of things be voluntary, and man's will
    free and unconstrained?]

    [Sidenote: But although Prescience, you may say, is not the
    necessary cause of future events, yet it is a sign that they shall
    necessarily happen, and hence it follows that, although there were
    no prescience, future events would still be an inevitable
    necessity.]

  ?ing is ? but it ne maki? nat ?e ?ing ?at it signifie?.

    THE NATURE OF TRUE KNOWLEDGE.]

    [Sidenote: If things are foreknown, you may contend they must

    by the imagination, by reason, and by the intelligence (of the
    Deity).]

  ? and ?e man hym self o?er weies wyt byholdi? hym. {and}

    existences in general discovers the particular species, but the
    eye of Intelligence soars still higher; for, going beyond the
    bounds of what is general, it surveys the _simple forms_
    themselves, by its own pure and subtle thought:]

    [Sidenote: But the Intelligence looking down (as from above) and
    having conceived the form, discerns all things that are below it,
    and comprehends what does not fall within the reach of the other
    faculties of the mind.]

    forms) by one effort of mind.]

    [Sidenote: Man is a rational two-footed animal, which, though it
    be a general idea, yet every one knows that man thus defined is
    perceived both by the imagination and the senses, notwithstanding
    that in this instance reason does not make use of imagination or
    the senses, but of her own rational conception.]

    [Sidenote: The imagination also, although it derives its power of
    seeing and forming figures from the senses, yet in the absence and
    without the use of the senses it considers and comprehends all
    sensible things by its own imaginative power.]

    the aid of foreign power.]

    of what is general she comprehends whatever is sensible and
    imaginable; but as to the senses and imagination, they cannot
    attain to the knowledge of what is general, since their knowledge
    is confined to material figures; and therefore in all real
    knowledge of things we must give the greatest credit to that
    faculty which has a more steadfast and perfect judgment of

    happen; and that which cannot do otherwise than happen, must needs
    happen_, and so bind me to admit a necessity, I must confess that
    things are under such a restraint; but it is a truth that we
    scarce can comprehend, unless we be acquainted with the Divine

    happen in relation to the Divine knowledge is necessary; but,
    considered in its own nature, seems free and absolute.]

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
